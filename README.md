Bb Buddha Machine
=================

I went to bed at 2am last night. The alarm went off at 6am this morning . It was waaaay too early to do much other than check the internets, so that's what I did, and found [inbflat.net](http://inbflat.net/). This site is magic.

Eventually I realized I had to stop playing with it and do some work, but I wanted to keep listening. So I made [the Bb Buddha Machine](http://tikirobot.net/BbBuddha).

It probably doesn't work in IE. It brings linux machines to their knees. But I listened to it for at least eight hours today. Enjoy!

### 2011 update:

Some awesome people have taken the Bb Buddha Machine and modified it to make new versions! Check them out:

* [Bb Buddha Machine](http://tikirobot.net/BbBuddha/)
* [Dynamic Buddha Machine](http://progsoc.org/~curious/software/art/bbdynamic/BbBuddha.html) - a version by curiousjapan that dynamically loads YouTube videos tagged with "In Bb 2.0" or any other phrase.
* [noiZe vieW](http://noise-view.bplaced.net/) - a version by Peter He using his own recordings of his circuit-bent instruments.
